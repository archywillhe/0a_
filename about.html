<!-- 0a.io is an initiative by Archy Will He under <a href="https://castella.art">castella.art</a>
<br/><br/>
It is an initiative for dreams-related immersive dance-theatres that touch the philosophies and sciences of dreaming, from both a semantics /semiotics and (meta-)mathematical perspectives. It tries to view everything (in both the inner and outer worlds) from the (meta-)perspective of "(meta-)reconstruction".
<br/><br/>
Coming up soon in 2024.
<br/><br/>
「0a.io：一切，以一种破碎的方式，都完整无缺」是一项致力于「梦」相关的沉浸式舞台剧的发起，希望可以带动更多艺术创作去从「梦」的哲学及科学中找到灵感、以语义/象征学和元数学相关视角去探讨。试图从元角度看待事物。一种对内外世界中的事物的“元重塑”。 -->

<!-- 1.
When a leaf first takes its form, the tree has completed a reconstruction by the assembly of cells based on information in the genomes. 

An embryo's heart is a reconstruction of her mom and dad's. 

Every organism is a reconstruction of their parents. 

And so is every star in the symphonies of supernovas. 

And so is every painting and song and poem and text message. And these paragraphs too ... reconstructing what I thought of when I thought of reconstruction, reconstructed in hopes that you too can form vivid pictures in mind of this more generalized notion of the word. 

2. 
From an emergentistic perspective, reconstruction can perhaps be dissected as an interplay between two fundamental properties in our world: 
- emergence (a fundamental property of complex systems) 
- humanly conceived forms 

For instance, if we remove some genes that control flower development in Arabis, and change the light levels to mimic summer, we would have restructured the emergence process, and it would grow a woody stem never otherwise seen in the species.

Humans tend to give things forms. When we see a tree, without saying “that is a tree”, in the mind's eye surfaces the abstract notion of a tree. If that is a tree inside a painting, the surrealists may say “ce n'est pas un arbre.” A French architect who overheard it would think of the 1965 essay A City Is Not a Tree.

All forms are humanly conceived. And with forms come labels and words and thoughts. The thought of a tree is a reconstruction of the form of a tree. And so is every thought that has ever been thought, and every sentence that has ever been uttered, a reconstruction. -->

All forms are humanly concevied. They reflect how we perceive the world, as we make sense of the emergence around us. And within us.

3.
Perphas it is in this way that we are conscious, as consciousness constantly reconstructs thoughts and ideas and memories and the meanings of things amist joys and sadness and the infinitude of feelings and qualia there are. 

In doing so, we are gifted with the ability to create and bring new things into this world. through utilizing physical tools, such as a wood carving knife, with abstract systems like mathematics, languages, and the manifestation of will through love. 

Celebrate this gift, even when the world feels like it is falling apart.

Because it is.  -->


<!-- 
From the seeds in the soil to the galaxies above, everything you see has been here since the beginning.

They are reconstruction of the same thing.

This everything that you see, including yourself, are all expressions of the same thing. There is only one of us here. You are me and I am you. We are all connected, and everything that happens to one of us happens to all of us.

You are immortal. You have always been and you will always be. You are not born and you do not die. You just are.

There is no need to worry about the future, because there is no future. There is only the present moment, which is all there ever is.

 Relax


 <br/>

You are not your body.

You are not your thoughts.

You are not your emotions.

You are not your experiences.

At the beginning of time,
When all was created from nothing,
And all was together, in unity,
The All divided, and became many,
The many became the seeds,
That grew into trees and flowers,
Then insects, and fish, and animals,
Then you, and me, and each of us.


In the beginning was the Word,
The Word wriggled like a fish in the primordial ooze.

Uncertain and seething was the Word.
Unfixed.

The Word became flesh
And dwelt among men -- a man among men, a woman among women, a child among children. -->
