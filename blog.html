   From an emergentistic perspective, reconstruction can be dissected as an interplay between two fundamental properties in our world:
   <br/>
 <ul><li>
    emergence (a fundamental property of complex systems)
    <br/></li>
   <li>
    humanly conceived forms
    <br/></li></ul>
<br/>
    Suppose you are in a garden with some arabidopsis. You use proteins to remove from them genes that control flower development, and give them more light than usual. By doing so, you've restructured the emergence process on a cellular level, and the arabidopsis would grow a tree-like stem never otherwise seen in the species. 
    <br/><br/>
    It has reconstructed more tree-ish properties, at least micro-structrually.
   <br/><br/>

    Images are from Melzer, Siegbert, et al. “Flowering-time genes modulate meristem determinacy and growth form in Arabidopsis thaliana.” Nature genetics 40.12 (2008). Also referenced in Georgia Ray's "There’s no such thing as a tree phylogenetically".

  <br/><br/>

  

  Humans tend to give things forms. When we see something resembling a tree, 
  without saying “this is a tree,” in the mind's eye surfaces the notion of a tree. 
  If that is a tree inside a painting, 
  the surrealists may say “ce n'est pas un arbre.” 
  A French architect who overheard it may think of 
  Christopher Alexander's 1965 essay 
  A City Is Not a Tree. <br/><br/>
And so imageries of forms dance along the rhythm at which context changes.

  <div style="font-size:0.9em">
    Here, a tree refers to an abstract structure with branches (as shown in the middle, where a city is broken down into sub-categories in a tree).
    A City Is Not a Tree, widely regarded as a landmark paper in urban design, is a critique on 
    pattern-matching-based thinking. It argues that trees will never be as all-encompassing as more intricate but higher-cost-to-visualize structures like semi-lattice. 
    At the right is a semi-lattice assessing relations among triangles in a painting.

    <!--     </div>

  <!-- And so these two groups preceive the world differently. -->
  <br/><br/>
  <!-- Those who discern systems at bird's-eye view would be more tempted to invoke abstracted forms. -->
  <!-- different humans use different abstracted forms to communicate their thoughts. -->

The same way that architects take glamour in figuring out complex systems that occupy the human world,
   surrealists are more concerned with the absurdity of reality and dreams. 
While an architect, enlightened by reading A City is Not a Tree, may be enticed to reconstruct their own thoughts as they discern systems at bird's-eye view, a surrealist on the other hand

 <!-- trying to reconstruct their own thoughts as they discern systems at bird's-eye view, a surrealist  -->
 may be tempted to relax the defintion of reconstruction above. <br/><br/>Perhaps we should encompass none-humanly conceived forms too, thought the surrealist. And so our new definition becomes:
<br/><br/><br/>
...reconstruction can be dissected as an interplay between: 
<ul><li>
  emergence (a fundamental property of complex systems)
  <br/></li>
 <li>
  all forms (humanly and none-humanly conceived)
  <br/></li></ul>
<br/><br/>
Voila! By doing so, we can start to see reconstruction all around us, most of which are inconceivable. 
From every sense we experience to every division of our cells, from every supernova of dying stars to every vibration of molecules ever existed... 
systems of no known origins and of no known names are being reconstructed in ways we do not understand.
<br/><br/>
In ancient Eastern philosophy we call it the Dao. In Kantianism we dub it the Noumenal world.
Or as Stephen Hawking (after proclaiming that philosophy is dead in 2010) would put it, side-effects of Model-dependent Realism.


<br/><br/>
 
Among them, perhaps the greatest and most mysterious of all, is the perpetual, constant reconstruction of the present in Planck time, 
giving the appearance of seamless continuity as the conscious mind navigates and experiences the world.

<br/><br/>
<div style="font-size:0.9em; margin-top:10px; color:#888">
Planck time (roughly 10<sup>-44</sup> of a second, derived from Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle) is the length of time at which no smaller meaningful length can be theoretically measured. It is conjectured that the structure of time breaks down in smaller intervals of Planck time.

<!-- They are as real as dreams are for they reflect the outter layers of reality we are in. -->
  <!-- By relaxing our defintion, -->
  <br/><br/>
  But this is not a simulation. To describe reality in such way would betray the words per se, for the word simulation invokes a sense of none-"realness". <br/><br/>My love, this is as real as it gets! This is a vinyl player. We're in <i>the music</i> right now.

 

  <br/>

  <!-- If there are no humans, there will be no humanly concevied forms. There will be no "reconstruction" in the sense that there will be no one to give forms to describe the emergences in the universe and their different stages. -->

Perphas it is in this way that we are conscious, as consciousness constantly reconstructs thoughts and ideas and memories and the meanings of things amist joys and sadness and the infinitude of feelings and qualia there are. 

In doing so, we are gifted with the ability to create and bring new things into this world. through utilizing physical tools, such as a wood carving knife, with abstract systems like mathematics, languages, and the manifestation of will through love. 

Celebrate this gift, even when the world feels like it is falling apart.
