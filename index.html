          <b style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our vision: humans are always more superior than A.I. </b>
          <br /><br />

          Humans possess a unique ability to constantly evolve and change.. the intrinsic quality that defines our
          humanity, as we move about in this world. Our physical body, composed of approximately 40 trillion cells, is
          the most intricate system in the universe. And beyond our individual experiences, we are part of a collective
          consciousness capable of grasping the profound truths of our universe.. that which we express through science
          and art, and in philosophies and theologies. The full potentials of the life energy in each of us are not to
          be underestimated.
          <br /><br />
          Whenever we live mindfully and stay connected with our hearts, we can embark on an endless journey of
          self-discovery and wonder, immersing ourselves in the marvels of this world while tapping into the profound
          wisdom of our intuition.
          <br /><br />
          In the Buddhist tradition, this characteristic of human is known as buddhadhatu, the Buddha Nature present in
          everyone fortunate enough to be born as a human. In Christianity, this is understood as the doctrine that all
          humans are created in the image of God (Genesis 1:26-27). In Islamism, this concept is referred to as fitrah
          (فطرة), the divine spirit that God has breathed into Adam.
