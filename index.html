          ArchGPT is dedicated to understanding the nature of consciousness and creating a new paradigm for interfacing
          with computers, via the use of methods such as LLM to deconstruct and decipher EEG signals of the
          EM waves
          produced by the brain.

          <br /><br />

          Humans possess a unique ability to constantly evolve and change.. the intrinsic quality that defines our
          humanity, as we move about in this world. Our physical body, composed of approximately 40 trillion cells, is
          the most intricate system in the universe. And beyond our individual experiences, we are part of a collective
          consciousness capable of grasping the profound truths of our universe.. that which we express through science
          and art, and in philosophies and theologies. The full potentials of the life energy in each of us are not to
          be underestimated.
          <br /><br />
          Whenever we live mindfully and stay connected with our hearts, we can embark on an endless journey of
          self-discovery and wonder, immersing ourselves in the marvels of this world while tapping into the profound
          wisdom of our intuition.
          <br /><br />
          In the Buddhist tradition, this characteristic of human is known as buddhadhatu, the Buddha Nature present in
          everyone fortunate enough to be born as a human. In Christianity, this is understood as the doctrine that all
          humans are created in the image of God (Genesis 1:26-27). In Islamism, this concept is referred to as fitrah
          (ŸÅÿ∑ÿ±ÿ©), the divine spirit that God has breathed into Adam.

        <!-- <blockquote style="background: #ddd; padding:20px">
          Hi there.
          <br /><br />
          Nice to see you've made it to the bottom of the web page.
          <br /><br />
          Here is an ergonomic hack for you: <u>using
            two keyboards at the same time can effectively prevent shoulder strain and improve your posture!</u>

          <br /><br />
          <div
            style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 0.9em;padding-left:5px; border-left: 3px solid #999; color:#444">
            The
            set-up can be similiar to
            the
            image
            above; or you can also position the two keyboards at the same vertical level. Either way, cushions can be
            deployed too. The bottom right of the pic is actually a dark-blue pillow for the right forearm.
          </div>
          <br />
          <b>[IN DETAILS]</b> i.e. to use one keyboard for the left
          hand (ü´≤: in charge of every key towards-the-left of around 5,T,G,V) and the other keyboard for the right hand
          (ü´±: in
          charge of every key towards-the-right of around 6,Y,H,B).
          <br /><br />
          Adjust the distance between the two keyboards at the whim of your arms! To optimize for the most natural
          position
          without your arms bending inwards (at the mercy in the width of one keyboard ).
          <br /><br />
          This way, you can keep your shoulders relaxed and prevent them from
          getting stiff. Give it a try and once you are used to it, you will never want to go back to using just one
          keyboard. Have a great day!
          <br /><br /><br /><br />
          TIPS:
          <br /><br />
          1. The additional keyboard should be the same size as your laptop's keyboard. What you want is to trick
          your brain into feeling that you are using just one keyboard. (And honestly it feels so nice once you get the
          hang of it!)
          <br /><br />
          2. For right-handere, you can place the additional keyboard at the left of your table for your left hand. So
          you leave your right
          hand
          free to use the trackpad/mouse. Everything should feel nature and comfortable. (And, with enough practices,
          very smooth!)
          <br /><br />
          3. Your shoulders are never designed to be enclosed in a cramped-up fixed position (i.e. proportional to a
          single
          keyboard) for long hours! To maximize comfort and Zen-ness, you want to
          keep your shoulders and arms relaxed and loose, and to effortlessly maintain a good posture for your upper
          body. Now that's hot ;)
          <br /><br />
          4. Combining two keyboards with eye-level monitor(s) and a good chair, you can naturally sit up straight as
          you operate your work station. Ultimiately, you want to be in a hyper-focus state while also being optimally
          relaxed, enjoying max comfort and productivity. üòâ
          <br /><br />
          Thus spoke the Master, "enter Zen from here; only now."<br /> <br />
          Live Long and Propser,<br />
