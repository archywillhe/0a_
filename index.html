          <b style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the heart of the ArchGPT Foundation, we believe that
            humans are
            always more superior than A.I. </b>
          <br /><br />

          Humans possess a unique ability to constantly evolve and change.. the intrinsic quality that defines our
          humanity, as we move about in this world. Our physical body, composed of approximately 40 trillion cells, is
          the most intricate system in the universe. And beyond our individual experiences, we are part of a collective
          consciousness capable of grasping the profound truths of our universe.. that which we express through science
          and art, and in philosophies and theologies. The full potentials of the life energy in each of us are not to
          be underestimated.
          <br /><br />
          Whenever we live mindfully and stay connected with our hearts, we can embark on an endless journey of
          self-discovery and wonder, immersing ourselves in the marvels of this world while tapping into the profound
          wisdom of our intuition.
          <br /><br />
          In the Buddhist tradition, this characteristic of human is known as buddhadhatu, the Buddha Nature present in
          everyone fortunate enough to be born as a human. In Christianity, this is understood as the doctrine that all
          humans are created in the image of God (Genesis 1:26-27). In Islamism, this concept is referred to as fitrah
          (ŸÅÿ∑ÿ±ÿ©), the divine spirit that God has breathed into Adam.

          We believe the best kind of productivity is rooted in Zen-living and working in mindfulness. It is in the
          profound communion with our innermost being that ingenuity and striking innovations may arise! As the old
          adage
          wisely counsels: ‚ÄúGovern your mind with the same rigor as your blade. In the calm of focused intent, you
          uncover both clarity and might.‚Äù

        <blockquote style="background: #ddd; padding:20px">
          Hi there.
          <br /><br />
          Nice to see you've made it to the bottom of the web page.
          <br /><br />
          Here is an ergonomic hack for you: using
          two keyboards at the same time can help you to prevent shoulder strain! (The set-up can be similiar to as
          shown in the image
          above; or you can also have them in the same verical level.)
          <br /><br />
          i.e. to use one keyboard for the left
          hand (ü´≤ in charge of every key towards-the-left of around 5,T,G,V) and the other keyboard for the right hand
          (ü´± in
          charge of every key towards-the-right of around 6,Y,H,B).
          <br /><br />
          This way, you can keep your shoulders relaxed and prevent them from
          getting stiff. Give it a try and once you are used to it, you will never want to go back to using just one
          keyboard. Have a great day!
          <br /><br />
          TIPS:
          <br /><br />
          1. The additional keyboard should be the same size as your laptop's keyboard. What you want is to trick
          your brain into feeling that you are using just one keyboard. (And honestly it feels so nice once you get the
          hang of it!)
          <br /><br />
          2. You can place the additional keyboard at the left of your table for your left hand. So you leave your right
          hand
          free to use the trackpad/mouse. Everything should feel nature and comfortable. (And, with enough practices,
          very smooth!)
          <br /><br /><br />
          Your shoulders are never designed to be enclosed in a cramped-up fixed position (i.e. proportional to a single
          keyboard) for long hours! To maximize comfort and Zen-ness, you want to
          keep your shoulders and arms relaxed and loose, and to keep your body in a good posture.
          <br /><br />
          Combining two-keyboards with eye-level monitor and a good chair, you can sit up straight and relaxed for the
          MAX comfort and productivity.
