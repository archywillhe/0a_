          <a style="color:black">Zeroth Arch-IO (or 0A.IO in short)</a> is an upcoming decentralized autonomous
          organization (DAO) for developing open-source frameworks and simulations with the aim to
          <br /><br />
          1. provide production-ready software systems and consultation services to governments around the world to
          utilize Large Language Models for administrative automation, integrated into a blockchain system to enhance
          accountability and transparency.<br /><br />
          2. push for the research and development of neurons-in-a-dish-driven AI humanoids, insectoids to advance
          medicines and replace
          human labour and health care providers for the ever-growing aging populations on Earth.

          1. and 2. can go in parallel and will be complimentary to each other. For 2, <a
            style="color:black">0A.IO</a>'s belief is that the key will be about designing and implementing a
          "consciousness
          orchestration" bio-computing
          framework that will enable these
          neurons to learn (mimicking the way biological brain works) and control robotic parts i.e. attaining
          psychomotor skills like balancing. This is highly likely
          the only feasible way to create fault tolerant systems with the highest energy-efficiency (as a consequence of
          <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2022.0029">the free energy principle in Bayesian
            mechanics</a>). By open-sourcing the softwares and research findings, everyone will be able to grow and
          farm neurons-in-a-dish in home-labs and combining them with hardwares to custom-build humanoids and
          insectoids. This will be significantly much more cost-effective than e.g. R&D systems Boston Dynamics had
          developed.
          <br /><br />

          <a style="color:black">0A.IO</a> only has a single agenda, and that is to pragmatically reduce unnecessary
          suffering for all sentient beings on Earth. This is important as humanity develops powerful AIs and better
          computational theroies of what consciousness is. It is only through mindfulness and the collective readiness
          to act and improve the existing status quo can we enhance the overall well-being of Earth's inhabitants, and
          cultivate a mutually beneficial coexistence.
          <br /><br />
          Taking inspiration from Buddhism, a fundamental belief of <a style="color:black">0A.IO</a> is that reducing
          suffering and exploring the structural complexity of consciousness will lead to novel solutions for hard
          problems in science and engineering e.g. from an <a style="font-family: inherit"
            href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/properties-emergent/">emergentist</a> perspecitve.
          This will also allow us to create a more connected and empathetic society that values symbiotic relationships
          for mutual growth.
          <br /><br />
          This would also mean departuring from anthropocentrism, in the sense of embracing a heliocentric-equivalent
          view of consciousness. The same way that the Galilean depaturing from geocentricism in the 1600-1800 had
          helped to pave the way
          for the modern era of
          scientific thought and discovery, none-anthropocentrism will free our languages and conceptualization of the
          world around us
          from
          self-imposed
          constraints. Moreover, anthropocentrism as an attitude often encourages self-entitlement
          across all cultures, fosters tribalism (e.g. "some humans are more equal than others"), justifies
          exploitation, and constantly undermines the sentience of other life forms (which often hold invaluable
          insights about the nature of being, optimization, and problem-solving). All of humanity's hard problems can
          only be solved if we are more mindful, collectively, and of progressing as a global society, taking
          accountability as a species and as individuals.

          In Eastern philosophies, the Tao (道) is that which precedes one. At <a style="color:black">0A.IO</a>, we hope
          to align ourselves with the Tao and bring more mindfulness, peace, and love into this world. We can do better
          than this.
          <br /><br />
          <br /><br />
          <i>
            <br /><br />
            The Tao begot one.<br />
            One begot two.<br />
            Two begot three.<br />
            And three begot the ten thousand things.<br /><br />

            The ten thousand things carry yin and embrace yang.<br />
            They achieve harmony by combining these forces.<br /><br />
