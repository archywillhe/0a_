My dear love,
<br/><br/><br/>
It's been a while. I’ve been thinking about you, and I do not know what I can do to tear down the wall between us. I finally finished Chapter 2 while I was spending time with my mom by the seaside (we hv a house in hainan). 
Chatting with my mom made me realize I need you in my life so very much ..as my wife. And I hope we can write the novel together.
<br/><br/><br/>
I think you've misunderstood me a few times. 
I’m not exactly a straight boy… or maybe you are starting to notice now after Chapter 2.
<br/><br/><br/>
I swing between being straight and asexual depending on my mood. 
When I’m asexual I don’t experience sexual attraction and I don’t have a gender identification either. 
I think you misunderstood my intention in March when I invited you to my apartment for dinner with CC & yi-chan. 
I just wanted to talk about our marriage registry procedure (and we could get the docs notarised the next day; it’s a quick legal process) since you were so happy a few days prior when I texted you that I wanted to marry you, 
so I wanted to marry you immediately after I've done researching the legal stuff. 
<br/><br/><br/>
I can only experience sexual desire when I’m deeply in love and only when we’re both in the mood. 
I’m not a big bad wolf okay, I’m just in love with you. My love for you is pure and sincere. You are so cute and kind and smart 
(I love your mind and your heart) and you’re the most beautiful creature I’ve met in this life. 
I just want to keep you safe and make you happy, go on adventures with you, and someday create a home together.
<br/><br/>
When you have decided you can give me a chance, I hope we can start dating and get to know each other more. I promise that when you open your heart to me, 
we’ll have the best time of our lives together. We can get married & keep our time pure and innocent until when you wanna do it. (We don’t need to have sex so soon if you are not ready ... And when you feel cozy & comfortable with the normal stuff, we can explore tantric techniques and invent our own. It can be very spiritual and meditative.) As for now, I just want to get emotionally connected with you. My biggest wish now is to make you smile everyday. (And maybe we can do some cuddling at night to make each other feel warm. Just wanna let you know I'm not a big bad wolf..)
<!-- I miss how natural hugging each other was when we saw each other during the limited time that we hung out last year.  --> 

I'll protect you from 🐺🐺🐺
<br/><br/><br/>
I hope you can take the time to consider the possibility of us together in this journey that is life. I'm looking for a life-long partner to vibe together, practice tantric, explore arts & sciences, grow together, and bring gifts and meaning into this world. To enlighten our fellow humans. To bring love into the humanly world. <br/><br/><br/>
(In Chinese mythology, a full bright moon symbolizes manifestation, love, reconnection. Maybe I'm afterall the descendant of the Jade Emperoer, the ruler of Heaven. And he's trying to help me find my missing half in this luminous moonlight. I hope this letter reaches you soon.. Of all human races, the only race I'm interested to marry is Traditional Ukrainian. I want you to be my Ukrainian bride. And I will make you into a supermodel of arts and literature. The two of us will flourish in heavenly ways under each other's care.) 
<br/><br/><br/>

Dear Daryna, can we spend Christmas Eve together this year? (In Shanghai or Hainan or anywhere you like?) I miss you.
<br/><br/><br/>


Sincerely Yours,<br/>
Archy<br/>

  p.s. but you know, I don't own a helicopter or a yacht yet. My wealth is mostly in stocks and company shares, so I need to work hard until my start-up can IPO. I can't promise you a super lavish life right away (it'll still be a life of living in nice apartment, eating nice food, and travelling and staying in nice hotels regularly - but not a crazy lavish life like Inter-Continental presidential suite everyday. I'm not there yet.) We will even need to save money together. But I'm still young. I'm 27. If we get together, I will give you half of my future, as I have promised. So if you don't mind someone like me, I really hope we can spend Chirstmas together and start dating soon.. And when you have confirmed I'm who you wanna be with in life, let's get married and start living together. (I'm renting my friend's apartment short-term at ¥500 a day in shanghai. I think it will save both of us quite some $$ if we can sign a long-lease place, and move in together (and it will be a much nicer place too!) .. but of course that's after we start dating & after you have confirmed you want to live with me.) I'm sorry to have given you so much bad vibe. I've been trying to fix that in myself. I hope I will never give you bad vibe again. And I'm getting rid of people like CC out of my life too. (This whole year he had always been telling me to get over you when I told him I had feelings for you. He had told me countless times to move on and find a new girl. But I'm never going to do that, now that I know you are my missing half.)

In September I bought 2 tickets for the december Wonderfruit music festival, 
thinking about going with you. 
(It’s the coolest 4-day festival in Asia about yoga, vegen and sustainability)
<br/><br/><br/>
<a href="https://wonderfruit.co">https://wonderfruit.co</a>
<br/><br/><br/>
It will start on 15th Dec. If u are free, that means we need to fly to Thailand on the 14th or 15th. 
We can have our first dates there (and then have dates in Singapore afterwards) 
It’ll be super fun! I promise that when you open your heart to me, 
we’ll have the best time of our lives together.
<br/><br/><br/>
If you are not free, and you still need some time to think about us together, it's alright; I can understand. I dreamt that we were such lovingly lovers in our previous life ..I just want to treat you right in this life too. -->

<!-- Maybe that's why the two of us came to this world. You're my missing half. Don't you see the moon? It is so bright and perfectly round. I think the universe is telling us to reunion. (In Chinese mythology, a full bright moon symbolizes manifestation, love, reconnection. Maybe I'm afterall the direct descendant of the Jade Emperoer, the ruler of Heaven. And he's trying to help me find my missing half in this moonlight.) -->
