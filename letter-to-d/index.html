My dear love,
<br/><br/><br/>
I wanna let you know I’ve been thinking about you, and I did not know what I could do to get you to reach out to me. I finally finished Chapter 2 while I was spending time with my mom by the seaside (we hv a house in hainan). 
Chatting with my mom made me realize I need you in my life so very much ..as my wife. And I hope we can write the novel together.
<br/><br/><br/>
I think you misunderstood me a few times. 
I’m not exactly a straight boy… or maybe you are starting to notice now after Chapter 2.
<br/><br/><br/>
I swing between being straight and asexual depending on my mood. 
When I’m asexual I don’t experience sexual attraction and I don’t have a gender identification either. 
I think you misunderstood my intention in March when I invited you to my apartment for dinner with CC & yi-chan. 
I just wanted to talk about our marriage registry procedure (and we could get the docs notarised the next day; it’s a quick legal process) since you were so happy a few days prior when I texted you that I wanted to marry you, 
so I wanted to marry you immediately after I've done researching the legal stuff. 
<br/><br/><br/>
I can only experience sexual desire when I’m deeply in love and only when we’re both in the mood. 
I’m not a big bad wolf okay, I’m just in love with you. My love for you is pure and sincere. You are so cute and kind and smart 
(I love your mind and your heart) and you’re the most beautiful creature I’ve met in this life. 
I just want to keep you safe and make you happy, go on adventures with you, and someday create a home together.
<br/><br/><br/>
If u can give me a chance, I hope we can start dating and get to know each other more. We can get married & keep our time pure and innocent until when you wanna do it. (We don’t need to have sex so soon if you are not ready ... And when you feel cozy & comfortable with the normal stuff, we can explore tantric techniques and invent our own. It can be very spiritual and meditative.) As for now, I just want to get emotionally connected with you. My biggest wish now is to see your smile everyday. And maybe we can do some cuddling at night to make each other feel warm. I miss how natural hugging each other was last year when we saw each other and when we said goodbye. 
<br/><br/><br/>
I hope you can take the time to consider the possibility of us together in this journey that is life. I'm looking for a life-long partner to vibe together, practice tantric, explore arts & sciences, grow together, and bring gifts and meaning into this world. To enlighten our fellow humans. To bring love into the humanly world. <br/><br/><br/>
Whether you have yet decided on us or not, whether it is a yes or a no, I just hope we can spend Chirstmas together this year.
<br/><br/>

(In Chinese mythology, a full bright moon symbolizes manifestation, love, reconnection. Maybe I'm afterall the direct descendant of the Jade Emperoer, the ruler of Heaven. And he's trying to help me find my missing half in this luminous moonlight. I hope this letter reaches you soon..) 
<br/><br/>

Sincerely Yours,<br/>
Archy<br/>

<!-- 
In September I bought 2 tickets for the december Wonderfruit music festival, 
thinking about going with you. 
(It’s the coolest 4-day festival in Asia about yoga, vegen and sustainability)
<br/><br/><br/>
<a href="https://wonderfruit.co">https://wonderfruit.co</a>
<br/><br/><br/>
It will start on 15th Dec. If u are free, that means we need to fly to Thailand on the 14th or 15th. 
We can have our first dates there (and then have dates in Singapore afterwards) 
It’ll be super fun! I promise that when you open your heart to me, 
we’ll have the best time of our lives together.
<br/><br/><br/>
If you are not free, and you still need some time to think about us together, it's alright; I can understand. I dreamt that we were such lovingly lovers in our previous life ..I just want to treat you right in this life too. -->

<!-- Maybe that's why the two of us came to this world. You're my missing half. Don't you see the moon? It is so bright and perfectly round. I think the universe is telling us to reunion. (In Chinese mythology, a full bright moon symbolizes manifestation, love, reconnection. Maybe I'm afterall the direct descendant of the Jade Emperoer, the ruler of Heaven. And he's trying to help me find my missing half in this moonlight.) -->
