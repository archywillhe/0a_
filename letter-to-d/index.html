My dear love,
<br/><br/><br/>
It's been a while. I’ve been thinking about you, and I do not know what I can do to tear down the wall between us. I finally finished Chapter 2 while I was spending time with my mom by the seaside (we hv a house in Hainan). 
Chatting with my mom made me realize I need you in my life so very much ..as my wife. And I hope we can write the novel together.
<br/><br/><br/>
I think you've misunderstood me a few times. 
I’m not exactly a straight boy… or maybe you are starting to notice now after Chapter 2.
<br/><br/><br/>
I swing between being straight and asexual depending on my mood. 
When I’m asexual I don’t experience sexual attraction/interest and I don’t have a gender identification either. 
I think you misunderstood my intention in March when I invited you to my apartment for dinner with CC & yi-chan. 
I just wanted to talk about our marriage registry procedure (and we could get the docs notarised the next day; it’s a quick legal process) since you were so happy a few days prior when I texted you that I wanted to marry you. So I wanted to marry you immediately after I'd done researching the legal stuff. 
<br/><br/><br/>
I can only experience sexual desire when I’m deeply in love and only when we’re both in the mood. 
I’m not a big bad wolf okay, I’m just in love with you. My love for you is pure and sincere. You are so cute and kind and smart 
(I love your mind and your heart) and you’re the most beautiful creature I’ve met in this life. We can get married and keep our time pure and innocent until when you wanna do it. (We don’t need to have sex so soon if you are not ready ... And when you feel cozy & comfortable with the normal stuff, we can explore tantric techniques and invent our own. It can be very spiritual and meditative.) I just want to keep you safe and make you happy, go on adventures with you, and someday create a home together. I'll protect you from 🐺🐺🐺
<br/><br/>
When you have decided to give me a chance, I hope we can start dating and get to know each other more. What's your favourite color? What sports do you like? What would you do on rainy days? What do you like in your borscht? There're so much I want to know about you. I promise that when you open your heart to me, we’ll have the best time of our lives together. My biggest wish now is to make you smile everyday. (And maybe we can do some cuddling at night to make each other feel warm. Just wanna let you know I'm not a big bad 🐺) 
<br/><br/><br/>
I hope you can take the time to consider the possibility of us together in this journey that is life. I'm looking for a life-long partner to vibe together, practice tantric, explore arts & sciences, grow together, and bring gifts and meaning into this world. To enlighten our fellow humans. To bring love into the humanly world. <br/><br/><br/>
(In Chinese mythology, a full bright moon symbolizes manifestation, love, reconnection. Maybe I'm afterall the descendant of the Jade Emperoer, the ruler of Heaven. And he's trying to help me find my missing half in this luminous moonlight. I hope this letter reaches you soon.. Of all human races, the only race I'm interested to marry is Traditional Ukrainian. I want you to be my Ukrainian bride. And I will make you into a supermodel of arts and literature.  Under each other's care the two of us will flourish in heavenly ways.) 
<br/><br/><br/>

Oh Dear Daryna, can we spend Christmas together this year? (In Shanghai or Wanning or anywhere you like)
<br/><br/><br/>


Sincerely Yours,<br/>
Archy<br/>

  p.s. but you know, I don't own a helicopter or a yacht yet. My wealth is mostly in stocks and company shares, so I need to work hard until my start-up can IPO. I can't promise you a super lavish life right away (it'll still be a life of living in nice apartment, eating nice food, and travelling and staying in nice hotels regularly - but not a crazy lavish life like Inter-Continental presidential suite everyday. I'm not there yet.) We will even need to save money together. But I'm still young-ish. I'm 27. If we get together, I will give you half of my future, as I have promised. So if you don't mind someone like me, I really hope we can spend Chirstmas together and start dating.. And when you have confirmed I'm who you wanna be with in life, let's get married and start living together. (I'm renting my friend's apartment short-term at ¥500 a day in shanghai. I think it will save both of us quite some $$ if we can sign a long-lease place, and move in together (and we can get a nicer apartment too!) ..but of course that's after we start dating & after you have confirmed you want to live with me.) I'm sorry to have given you so much bad vibe. I've been trying to fix that in myself. I have only love and positive energy for you. (I'm getting rid of CC and Turkey out of my life too. They had been demotivating me from the start. CC knew I was in love when I first met you. I tried to ask him for advices but he told me countless times (since last December) to move on and find a new girl. And I will never do that, now that I know you are the soul mate I've been searching for all these years.)
  </i>
  <br/><br/>

  (I think it was because they both have feelings for you too. (CC got really jealous last December when he knew you and I started hanging out.) You have the loveliest smile in this world. You are too enchanting for the human souls. This is why I'm intimidated by your beauty too. It is very powerful. And so in a more abstract way, I do believe Dostoevsky's words very deeply. Beauty will save the world.) Oh Dear Daryna ..Will you save mine?

In September I bought 2 tickets for the december Wonderfruit music festival, 
thinking about going with you. 
(It’s the coolest 4-day festival in Asia about yoga, vegen and sustainability)
<br/><br/><br/>
<a href="https://wonderfruit.co">https://wonderfruit.co</a>
<br/><br/><br/>
It will start on 15th Dec. If u are free, that means we need to fly to Thailand on the 14th or 15th. 
We can have our first dates there (and then have dates in Singapore afterwards) 
It’ll be super fun! I promise that when you open your heart to me, 
we’ll have the best time of our lives together.
<br/><br/><br/>
If you are not free, and you still need some time to think about us together, it's alright; I can understand. I dreamt that we were such lovingly lovers in our previous life ..I just want to treat you right in this life too. -->

<!-- Maybe that's why the two of us came to this world. You're my missing half. Don't you see the moon? It is so bright and perfectly round. I think the universe is telling us to reunion. (In Chinese mythology, a full bright moon symbolizes manifestation, love, reconnection. Maybe I'm afterall the direct descendant of the Jade Emperoer, the ruler of Heaven. And he's trying to help me find my missing half in this moonlight.) -->
