To the girl of my dream,
<br/><br/><br/>
It's been a while. I’ve been thinking about you, and I do not know what I can do to tear down the wall between us. I finally finished Chapter 2 while I was spending time with my mom by the seaside (we hv a house in Hainan). 
Chatting with my mom made me realize I need you in my life so very much ..as my wife. And I hope we can write the novel together.
<br/><br/><br/>
I think you've misunderstood me a few times. 
I’m not exactly a straight boy… or maybe you are starting to notice now as you read Chapter 2. (You can find a copy hidden in Xime.)
<br/><br/><br/>
I swing between being straight and asexual depending on my mood. 
When I’m asexual I don’t experience sexual attraction and I don’t have a gender identification either. 
I think you misunderstood my intention in March when I invited you to my apartment for dinner with CC & yi-chan. 
I just wanted to talk about our marriage registry procedure (and we could get the docs notarised the next day; it’s a quick legal process) since you were so happy a few days prior when I texted you that I would love to do the marriage visa with you. So I wanted to marry you immediately after I'd done researching the legal stuff. 
<br/><br/>
I can only experience sexual desire when I’m deeply in love and only when we’re both in the mood. 
I’m not a big bad wolf okay, I’m just in love with you. My love for you is pure and sincere. You are so cute and kind and smart 
(I love your mind and your heart) and you’re the most beautiful creature I’ve met in this life. We can get married and keep our time pure and innocent, taking things cozy and slow until when you are ready and wanna do it (...and when you feel comfortable, we can explore tantric techniques and invent our own. It can be very spiritual and meditative, and rejuvenating too.) For now, my biggest wish is to bring you joy and make you smile everyday. (And maybe we can do some cuddling at night to make each other feel warm. Just wanna let you know I'm not a 🐺.. Or even if I am, I'm more like a cute docile husky 🐕..) I'll protect you from 🐺🐺🐺. All I want is to keep you safe and make you happy, go on adventures with you around the world, and someday create a home together.
<br/><br/><br/>
When you have decided to give me a chance, let's start dating and get to know each other more? What's your favourite color? What sports do you like? What would you do on rainy days? What do you like in your borscht? There are so much I want to know about you. I promise that when you open your heart to me, we’ll have the best time of our lives together. Let's go to Hokkaido and Naoshima in January? 🥡🌸⛩💕👘🏮🎏🎎🍱
<br/><br/><br/>
I hope you can take the time to consider the possibility of us together in this journey that is life. I'm looking for a life-long partner to vibe together, practice tantric, explore arts & sciences, grow together, and bring gifts and meaning into this world. To enlighten our fellow humans. To bring love into the humanly world. <br/><br/><br/>
(In Chinese mythology, a full bright moon symbolizes manifestation, love, reconnection. Maybe I'm afterall the descendant of the Jade Emperoer, the ruler of Heaven. And he's trying to help me find my missing half in this luminous moonlight. I hope this letter reaches you soon.. Of all human races, the only race I'm interested to marry is Traditional Ukrainian. I want you to be my Ukrainian bride. And I will make you into a supermodel of arts and literature.  The two of us will flourish in heavenly ways under each other's care, and the Earth will be nice again) 
<br/><br/><br/>

Sincerely Yours,<br/>
And Yours only,<br/>
Archy<br/>

Oh Dear Daryna, can we spend Christmas together this year? Or if you are not yet ready to talk, it would be nice to just see each other under the same roof. I will be in the Rockbund Art Museum from 3 to 6pm on the 25th for Trinh T. Minh-ha's exhibition, <a href="http://www.rockbundartmuseum.org/en/exhibition/overview/cc2ctum" target="_blank"><i>Traveling in the Dark</i></a>. It is about reality and "knowing", presented in a feminine and gentle perspective. I've been on a journey to explore my inner feminine energy ever since you rejected me in the train station that day. I'm sorry to have approached you so ungently. And I'm sorry for harsh words I wrote. Sometimes, I'm really bad with words. I'm bad with my own feelings. (I need to rediscover my inner peace)
<br/><br/>
I hope I can see you in the Rockbund Art Museum. We don't need to talk if you are still doing a lot of thinking and are not ready yet. I would be content to just be able to see you from a distance. I miss you so much. 
<br/><br/><br/>

  p.s. but you know, I don't own a helicopter or a yacht yet. My wealth is mostly in stocks and company shares, so I need to work hard until my start-up can IPO. I can't promise you a super lavish life right away (it'll still be a life of living in nice apartment, eating nice food, and travelling and staying in nice hotels regularly - but not a crazy lavish life like Inter-Continental presidential suite everyday. I'm not there yet.) We will even need to save money together. But I'm still young-ish. I'm 27. If we get together, I will give you half of my future, as I have promised. So if you don't mind someone like me, I really hope we can spend Chirstmas together and start dating.. And when you have confirmed I'm who you wanna be with in life, let's get married and start living together. (I'm renting my friend's apartment short-term at ¥500 a day in shanghai. I think it will save both of us quite some ¥¥ if we can sign a long-lease place, and move in together (and the apartment would be nicer too) ..but of course that's after we start dating & after you have confirmed you want to live with me.) I'm sorry to have given you so much bad vibe. I've been trying to fix that in myself. I have only love and positive energy for you. (I'm getting rid of CC and Turkey out of my life too. They had been demotivating me from the start. CC knew I was in love with you. I tried to ask him for advices but he told me countless times (since last December) that there are so many pretty girls and I should find a new girl and move on. And I will never do that, now that I know you are the soulmate I've been searching for all these years.) 
  <br/><br/>
  In my dreams we have a happy and vibrantly alive peaceful life together. Vibrantly alive peace - that is the joy of *being*. The formless and timeless reality as the unmanifested life that animates our physical forms. And when we can look beyond the veil of form and separation. That is the realization of oneness. That is love.</i>
  <br/><br/><br/>

  <i>p.p.s. 
  So many people are getting covid now. Take care! Drink lots of water and hydrate well! Hope you are doing good (And if you haven't gotten covid yet, after we start dating, we can visit Singapore together and I'll arrange the Pfizer vaccine for you? It's quite effective. We can get many good medicines & nutritional supplements together; I need to refill my supply too) </i>
  <br/><br/>
  <br/>
<i>  p.p.p.s. Merry Christmas 🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄 </i>

In September I bought 2 tickets for the december Wonderfruit music festival, 
thinking about going with you. 
(It’s the coolest 4-day festival in Asia about yoga, vegen and sustainability)
<br/><br/><br/>
<a href="https://wonderfruit.co">https://wonderfruit.co</a>
<br/><br/><br/>
It will start on 15th Dec. If u are free, that means we need to fly to Thailand on the 14th or 15th. 
We can have our first dates there (and then have dates in Singapore afterwards) 
It’ll be super fun! I promise that when you open your heart to me, 
we’ll have the best time of our lives together.
<br/><br/><br/>
If you are not free, and you still need some time to think about us together, it's alright; I can understand. I dreamt that we were such lovingly lovers in our previous life ..I just want to treat you right in this life too. -->

<!-- Maybe that's why the two of us came to this world. You're my missing half. Don't you see the moon? It is so bright and perfectly round. I think the universe is telling us to reunion. (In Chinese mythology, a full bright moon symbolizes manifestation, love, reconnection. Maybe I'm afterall the direct descendant of the Jade Emperoer, the ruler of Heaven. And he's trying to help me find my missing half in this moonlight.) -->
