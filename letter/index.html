Hey,
<br/><br/><br/>
I want to be your angel. Sorry I have not been a good angel.
<br/><br/><br/>
I'm so sorry I made you so angry last week. Please accept the ring as an apology.
<br/><br/><br/>
I wanted to pass you the book in XIME a month ago when we met. But the typesetting and publishing took so long, and it was only finished last Thursday. I rewrote the story in August (based on the original version in June), just wanting to let you know that I missed you and I hoped you'd been doing fine. And also that I did not know how to approach you. You felt so far away. Like a princess in a distant galaxy.
<br/><br/><br/>
I miss our time together last year.
<br/><br/><br/>
I hope we can do the "end-year thing" and spend Christmas together (since we didn't get to do the "start-year thing" in Jan&Feb). We don't need to talk if you're still angry at me; we can just be in the same space like when we're at keepitquiet.
<br/><br/><br/>
Love,<br/>
