<!-- You have a legendary life, and I deeply admire your intuition for knowledge and wisdom. After meeting with you a couple of times in 2021,

When you raised your leg with such elegance as to show me your injury during your dance classes in the Japanese restaurant that day (back in January), I realized I was in love. The way you lifted up your right leg as you spoke was so mesmerizing, it left a mark in my heart. I was in love with you since we met. I just had not realized it up until that point. But that was when my fear deepened too. That day I wanted to ask if you were still dating the guy who had a girlfriend. But I avoided it, because I couldn’t face the possibility of you saying yes. Oh daring, please give me one more chance.

You have a legendary life, and you are the first person who touched my heart with your attentive eyes as you asked all the very smart questions, and how you processed what I said with such grace - I’m both enchanted and frightened by your intellect and beauty. I deeply admire your intuition for knowledge and wisdom. After meeting with you a couple of times in 2021, a thought came to me.. “I want to have kids with this person.” And it frightened me. I never had such a thought in my life before. Oh daring, please give me one more chance. Let’s freeze your eggs in Singapore.  These kids are going to be so damn amazing with your genes and mine. 

<br/><br/><br/>
And you are so cute. Your smile is so lovely. It’s almost like I can taste them. Як приємно солодко з таким чарівним післясмаком. When you smiled at me in the Shangri-la restaurant last December and told me you think I’m the person who you could trust to do magical mushroom together, my heart melted.  Oh daring, please give me one more chance. You are the girl of my dream. -->
