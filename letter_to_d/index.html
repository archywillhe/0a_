Dear D., 
<br/><br/><br/>
I cancelled my flight. I'm not leaving Shanghai. The truth is that I want to leave Shanghai with you. As long as you are not leaving yet, I will not leave. I'll try to cope with my depression somehow. (I'm moving to a cheaper apartment now cuz I was paying 600 a/day previously.) 
<br/><br/>
When I said in August I wanted to bring you to travel around the world with me, I meant it. I still do.
<br/><br/><br/>
I want to be your angel, guarding and guiding you in life. Sorry I have not been a good angel. <br/><br/><br/>
I'm so sorry I made you so angry last week. I had written you many letters. But I did not know which one to send. I knew I sent a bad one. I'm so sorry.
<br/><br/><br/>
Btw, I wanted to pass you the book in XIME a month ago when we met. But the typesetting and publishing took so long, and it was only finished last Thursday. After you've blocked me in August, I was really confused but I knew you needed space. So I rewrote the story just wanting to let you know that I missed you a lot and I hoped you'd been doing fine. And also that I did not know how to approach you. You felt so far away. Like a princess in a distant galaxy.
<br/><br/><br/>
When can I have dinner with my princess again? And let's do the end-year thing? (since we didn't get to do the start-year thing)
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Love,<br/>
