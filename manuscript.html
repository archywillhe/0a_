<h1>1.</h1>
<p>
  From the seeds in the soil to the stars above <br/>
  Everything has been here since the beginning
<br/><br/>
Everything - including yourself - is made of the same stuff<br/>
You too have been here since the beginning
<br/><br/>
The universe is one single organism<br/> 
It dances and sings with ever-changing forms<br/>
We are all reconstruction of reconstruction <br/>
  <br/><br/>
<!-- 
  And so is every painting and song and poem and text message. And these paragraphs too ... reconstructing what I thought of when I thought of reconstruction, reconstructed in hopes that you too can form vivid pictures in mind of this more generalized notion of the word.
   -->
  <!-- <br/><br/><br/> -->

  <h1>2.</h1>
   From an emergentistic perspective, reconstruction can be dissected as an interplay between two fundamental properties in our world:
   <br/>
 <ul><li>
    emergence (a fundamental property of complex systems)
    <br/></li>
   <li>
    humanly conceived forms
    <br/></li></ul>
<br/>
    Suppose you are in a garden with some arabidopsis. You use proteins to remove from them genes that control flower development, and give them more light than usual. By doing so, you've restructured the emergence process on a cellular level, and the arabidopsis would grow a tree-like stem never otherwise seen in the species. 
    <br/><br/>
    It has reconstructed more tree-ish properties, at least micro-structrually.
   <br/><br/>
   <img src="./woodyaridopsis.png"/>
   
   <div style="font-size:0.9em">At the left we see a close-up of the woody stem of a metamorphosed arabidopsis. The image at the right compares a metamorphosed arabidopsis with a normal flowered arabidopsis.</div>
   <div style="font-size:0.9em; margin-top:10px; color:#888">
    Images are from Melzer, Siegbert, et al. “Flowering-time genes modulate meristem determinacy and growth form in Arabidopsis thaliana.” Nature genetics 40.12 (2008). Also referenced in Georgia Ray's "There’s no such thing as a tree phylogenetically".
  </div>
  <br/><br/>

  

  Humans tend to give things forms. When we see something resembling a tree, 
  without saying “this is a tree,” in the mind's eye surfaces the notion of a tree. 
  If that is a tree inside a painting, 
  the surrealists may say “ce n'est pas un arbre.” 
  A French architect who overheard it may think of 
  Christopher Alexander's 1965 essay 
  A City Is Not a Tree. <br/><br/>
And so imageries of forms dance along the rhythm at which context changes.

  <br/><br/>
  <div>

</div>
  <div style="font-size:0.9em">
    Here, a tree refers to an abstract structure with branches (as shown in the middle, where a city is broken down into sub-categories in a tree).
    A City Is Not a Tree, widely regarded as a landmark paper in modern design, is a critique on 
    pattern-matching-based thinking. It argues that trees will never be as all-encompassing as more intricate but higher-cost-to-visualize structures like semi-lattice. 
    At the right is a semi-lattice assessing relations among triangles in a painting.
    

    <!-- showing that,
    but lacks the straight-forwardness of a tree. -->
</div>
    <!--     </div>
     is in many ways a critique of pattern-matching-based design thinking, where one has the tendency to use more neatly-knitted abstraction like tree stutures (as depicted in ), which comes with many downsides realistically. Meanwhile,  -->

  <!-- And so these two groups preceive the world differently. -->
  <br/><br/>
  <!-- Those who discern systems at bird's-eye view would be more tempted to invoke abstracted forms. -->
  <!-- different humans use different abstracted forms to communicate their thoughts. -->

The same way that architects take glamour in figuring out complex systems that occupy the human world,
   surrealists are more concerned with the absurdity of reality and dreams. 
While an architect, enlightened by reading A City is Not a Tree, may be enticed to reconstruct their own thoughts as they discern systems at bird's-eye view, a surrealist on the other hand

 <!-- trying to reconstruct their own thoughts as they discern systems at bird's-eye view, a surrealist  -->
 may be tempted to relax the defintion of reconstruction above. <br/><br/>Perhaps we should encompass none-humanly conceived forms too, thought the surrealist. And so our new definition becomes:
<br/><br/><br/>
...reconstruction can be dissected as an interplay between: 
<ul><li>
  emergence (a fundamental property of complex systems)
  <br/></li>
 <li>
  all forms (humanly and none-humanly conceived)
  <br/></li></ul>
<br/><br/>
Voila! By doing so, we can start to see reconstruction all around us, most of which are inconceivable. 
From every sense we experience to every division of our cells, from every supernova of dying stars to every vibration of molecules ever existed... 
systems of no known origins and of no known names are being reconstructed in ways we do not understand.
<br/><br/>
In ancient Eastern philosophy we call it the Dao. In Kantianism we dub it the Noumenal world.
Or as Stephen Hawking (after proclaiming that philosophy is dead in 2010) would put it, side-effects of Model-dependent Realism.


<br/><br/>
 
Among them, perhaps the greatest and most mysterious of all, is the perpetual, constant reconstruction of the present in Planck time, 
giving the appearance of seamless continuity as the conscious mind navigates and experiences the world.

<br/><br/>
<div style="font-size:0.9em; margin-top:10px; color:#888">
Planck time (roughly 10<sup>-44</sup> of a second, derived from Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle) is the length of time at which no smaller meaningful length can be theoretically measured. It is conjectured that the structure of time breaks down in smaller intervals of Planck time.
</div>

<!-- They are as real as dreams are for they reflect the outter layers of reality we are in. -->
  <!-- By relaxing our defintion, -->
  <br/><br/>
  But this is not a simulation. To describe reality in such way would betray the words per se, for the word simulation invokes a sense of none-"realness". <br/><br/>My love, this is as real as it gets! This is a record player. We're in <i>the music</i> right now.

 

  <br/>
  
    <br/><br/>

  <!-- If there are no humans, there will be no humanly concevied forms. There will be no "reconstruction" in the sense that there will be no one to give forms to describe the emergences in the universe and their different stages. -->
  
  
  <!-- reflect how we perceive the world, as we make sense of the emergence around us. And within us. -->

When the character Love(爱; ài) has no heart(心; xīn) in it*<it></it>, 
will the exhibition titled "Shrine爱 1.0" have actual love in it? 
Shrine爱 1.0 is an exhibition exploring reconstruction of "spirituality" in terms of worldbuilding.
<br/><br/>
<div style="font-size:0.9em; margin-top:10px; color:#888">
  * Love was traditionally written with a 心 in it: 「愛」。 
  The variance 爱 as a replacement for 愛 was proposed in the 1955 Chinese Character Simplification Scheme

<!-- Reality is overlapped with the new and the old, the imagined and the empirical,  ... -->
<!-- Should worldbuilders be considered the new God, or are they merely ? -->

In every new world being built we find traces of the old worlds, 
every imagined world traces of the empirical, 
every theological world traces of the innate, subtle, spiritual...
<br/><br/>
The Chinese word World (世界; shì jiè) was originally a Buddhist term 
coined by 300BCE monk Kumārajīva to mean 
"a space where living things live and revolve around, 
wherein a Buddha spreads his teachings". 
<!-- Its modern day meaning came from its metaphorical usages in ancient poems and literatures, espeically during the Tang dynasty. -->

<div style="font-size:0.9em; margin-top:10px; color:#888">
In Buddhist cosmology, there are infinitely many universes,
each a collection of a billion Worlds.
Within each universe, there is a Buddha who traverses these Worlds 
to spread his teachings for the love of all sentient beings, so everyone can reach enlightenment.
Aside from humans, sentient beings include animals, as well as nature spirits, demons, deities...
Some may achieve enlightenment in their current lifetime, some may be able to do so in the next lifetime, and so on. It's all a learning experience.

after going through their own cycle of reincarnation, and finally break free. -->

In the Buddhist multiverse, the omnipotent God (in the conception of the word <i>theos</i>)
is then the structural complexity of the multiverse, 
which transcends and governs everything within.
<br/><br/>
In every world conceivable by the mind are glimpses of the Holy Spirit. 
Be it a mythical world, an imagined world, a digital world, a mathematical model, or the world as one knows about 
through stories, beliefs, and interactions.<br/><br/>

Existing within the structural complexity of every world is a reflection of the spirituality 
in every object, entity, and organism around us,
in the sense that they, when grouped together and positioned in a specific way, have the potentials 
to bring forth qualia that goes beyond 
the undertones of cultures and languages. 
A shared experience that is primitive and shamanistic in nature that which we do not understand.

<!-- when positioned at the right,
a shared experience is created,  -->

 <br/><br/>
<!-- from which stories can be told, and worlds are built. -->
Shrine爱 1.0 is an attempt to venerate and reconstruct such "spirituality"
through the juxtaposition of technologies and senses in a mix of
worlds. These are worlds arose from emergence among, as well as individually, in 
selected works by five artists of different disciplines.
<br/><br/>
Can a humble art exhibition restore in each of its visitors a little sense of "spirituality" in this (post)modern world characterized largely 
by stress and stress-coping mechanisms? 

<!-- As technology advances, how can we better feel the Gods in the worlds surrounnding the human experience? -->

And so is every painting and song and poem and text message. And these paragraphs too ... reconstructing what I thought of when I thought of reconstruction, reconstructed in hopes that you too can form vivid pictures in mind of this more generalized notion of the word.

From an emergentistic perspective, reconstruction can perhaps be dissected as an interplay between two fundamental properties in our world: 
- emergence (a fundamental property of complex systems) 
- humanly conceived forms 

For instance, if we remove some genes that control flower development in Arabis, and change the light levels to mimic summer, we would have restructured the emergence process, and it would grow a woody stem never otherwise seen in the species.

Humans tend to give things forms. When we see a tree, without saying “that is a tree”, in the mind's eye surfaces the abstract notion of a tree. If that is a tree inside a painting, the surrealists may say “ce n'est pas un arbre.” A French architect who overheard it would think of the 1965 essay A City Is Not a Tree.

All forms are humanly conceived. And with forms come labels and words and thoughts. The thought of a tree is a reconstruction of the form of a tree. And so is every thought that has ever been thought, and every sentence that has ever been uttered, a reconstruction. -->

When a leaf first takes its form, the tree has completed a reconstruction by the assembly of cells based on information in the genomes. 

An embryo's heart is a reconstruction of her mom and dad's.

All forms are humanly concevied. They reflect how we perceive the world, as we make sense of the emergence around us. And within us.

Perphas it is in this way that we are conscious, as consciousness constantly reconstructs thoughts and ideas and memories and the meanings of things amist joys and sadness and the infinitude of feelings and qualia there are. 

In doing so, we are gifted with the ability to create and bring new things into this world. through utilizing physical tools, such as a wood carving knife, with abstract systems like mathematics, languages, and the manifestation of will through love. 

Celebrate this gift, even when the world feels like it is falling apart.

Because it is.  -->

From the seeds in the soil to the galaxies above, everything you see has been here since the beginning.

They are reconstruction of the same thing.

This everything that you see, including yourself, are all expressions of the same thing. There is only one of us here. You are me and I am you. We are all connected, and everything that happens to one of us happens to all of us.

You are immortal. You have always been and you will always be. You are not born and you do not die. You just are.

There is no need to worry about the future, because there is no future. There is only the present moment, which is all there ever is.

 Relax


 <br/>

You are not your body.

You are not your thoughts.

You are not your emotions.

You are not your experiences.

At the beginning of time,
When all was created from nothing,
And all was together, in unity,
The All divided, and became many,
The many became the seeds,
That grew into trees and flowers,
Then insects, and fish, and animals,
Then you, and me, and each of us.


In the beginning was the Word,
The Word wriggled like a fish in the primordial ooze.

Uncertain and seething was the Word.
Unfixed.

The Word became flesh
And dwelt among men -- a man among men, a woman among women, a child among children. -->
