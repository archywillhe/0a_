  When a leaf first takes its form, the tree has completed a reconstruction by the assembly of cells based on information in the genomes.
<br/><br/>
An embryo's heart is a reconstruction of her mom' and dad's.
<br/><br/>
  All organisms are reconstruction of their parents.
  <br/><br/>  
  And so are stars that went supernova, and then from which new planents and stars are formed.
  <br/><br/> 
  Everything in the universe is in some way a reconstruction.
  <br/><br/>
  As you read these words, you are reconstructing what I had in mind. 
  <br/><br/>
  It is in this way that we are conscious, as consciousness constantly reconstructs thoughts and ideas and memories and the meanings of things amist joys and sadness and the infinitude of feelings and qualia there are. 
  <br/><br/>
  In doing so, we are gifted with the ability to create, build and bring new things into this world, through the utilization of physical (eg wood carving knives) and abstract tools (eg mathematics and languages) as billions of cells collaborative with each other to reconstruct the symphonies that are the movements of the hand, pumping of the heart, etc. 
  <br/><br/>
  Celebrate this gift, even when the world feels like it is falling apart. Because it is.

From an <a href="">emergentistic perspective</a>, reconstruction can perhaps be dissected as an interplay between two fundamental properties in our world:
<br/>
- <a href="">emergence (a fundamental property of complex systems)</a><br/>
- humanly conceived forms (a fundamental property of the mind, that which had troubled <a href="">Poincaré, Plato, Lao Tzu, et al</a>)

When a leaf first takes its form, the tree has completed a reconstruction by the assembly of cells based on information in the genomes. All organisms are reconstruction of their parents. And so are stars that went supernova, and then from which new planents and stars are formed.
Everything in the universe is in some way a reconstruction of past states, depending on how forms are conceived. 

<!-- Considering that all conceivable forms are mental constructs we use to interpret sensory data from our organs,  -->

<br/><br/>

As you read these words, you are reconstructing what was on my mind as you assemble concepts into shapes that are intutively sensible to you. It is delightful to experience the snap-fitting of these shapes as new thoughts are formed, espeically if they resonate with you.

<!-- From a representational presepective, a carpenter's making of woodwork is also a form of reconstruction, and so is the beholding of the woodwork.  -->


<!-- And so are paintings and songs and private letters and text messages. This underlines all man-made representations, And so are these very paragraphs per se (ie as a reconstruction of what I thought of when I thought of reconstruction, reconstructed in hopes that you too can form vivid pictures in mind of this more generalized notion of the word). -->

<!-- Unexpected emergence reflects something about our world that we do not yet quite understand. It is as if there is an invisible upper bound applied to how much one can expect a complex model to behave, and then rabbit holes open up . -->
<!-- In a somewhat similar way, the conceptualisation of forms continues to evolve as we question   -->

<!-- And it is in this way that reconstruction happens.  -->

                  Castella is inspired by the late Leo Castelli, <br>

                  we believe in the limitation of expressionism,<br/>
                  the emptiness within that which recurs ad infinitum.
                  <br><br>
                  Lao Tzu once said, "The ten thousand things<br>
                  carry yin and embrace yang. They achieve<br>
                  harmony by combining these forces."

                  As much as we are optimistic in the singularity,<br>
                  we subscribe to the down-fall of us collectively.
