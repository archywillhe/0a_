When a leaf first takes its form, the tree has completed a reconstruction by the assembly of cells based on information in the genomes.

An embryo's heart is a reconstruction of her mom and dad's.

All organisms are reconstruction of their parents.

And so are stars in the symphonies of supernova.

And so are paintings and songs and poems and text messages.

And so are these paragraphs per se ... a reconstruction of what I thought of when I thought of reconstruction, reconstructed in hopes that you too can form vivid pictures in mind of this more generalized notion of the word.



Perphas it is in this way that we are conscious, as consciousness constantly reconstructs thoughts and ideas and memories and the meanings of things amist joys and sadness and the infinitude of feelings and qualia there are.

In doing so, we are gifted with the ability to create and bring new things into this world through the utilization of physical tools, such as a wood carving knife; and abstract systems, such as mathematics, languages, and the manifestation of will through love.

Celebrate this gift, even when the world feels like it is falling apart.

Because it is.

叶子的形成是这棵树对“叶”的重塑。这是建立于这棵树基因里所编码的信息的重塑。
胎儿的心脏是胎儿对父母心脏的重塑。每个生物的存在都是此生物对父母体的重塑。
在超新星的交响乐中，每个天文物体也都是在在物理层面的一种重塑。
每幅画，每首歌，每首诗，每条短信也都是在重塑着什么，从表征层面上来说。
而此刻你在读的这些文字，重塑着我在思考重塑这个概念时所产生的重塑。
这是建立在文字表达上的重塑，盼读者可以在脑海中对此词有一种词意上的重塑。

意识的存在或许

我们是如何意识到这一切的？我们的意识也是在不停的对思考，想法，记忆和对事物的理解进行「重塑」， 并且带着喜悦和悲伤。

我们通过使用物理工具，如一把木雕

此为天赋之物也。

庆祝这份礼物，即便感觉世界正在倒塌。

因为世界确实正在倒塌。
