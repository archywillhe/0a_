      Castella Terms of Use
    </h1>
    <p>
      <br/>
      Welcome to Castella!<br/>

      These Terms of Use govern your use of Castella and provide information about the Castella Service. When you create an Castella account or use Castella, you agree to these terms.<br/>

      The Castella Service
We agree to provide you with the Castella Service. The Service includes all of the Castella products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Castella's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):<br/>

Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.
People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Castella, based on things you and others do on and off Castella.<br/>

Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.<br/>

We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other Castella Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.
Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.<br/>

Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Castella Company Products.<br/>

Castella is part of the Castella Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Castella Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Castella Company Products.<br/>
Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.<br/>
To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Castella Inc., Castella Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.<br/>

Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.<br/>
We use data from Castella and other Castella Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Castella.<br/>
Research and innovation.<br/>
We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.

    Things you and others do and provide.<br/>
    Information and content you provide. We collect the content, communications and other information you provide when you use our Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or communicate with others. This can include information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include what you see through features we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things like suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process content and communications you and others provide to analyze context and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about how you can control who can see the things you share.<br/>
    Data with special protections: You can choose to provide information in your Castella profile fields or Life Events about your religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject to special protections under the laws of your country.<br/>
    Networks and connections. We collect information about the people, Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as people you communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know and for the other purposes listed below.<br/>
    Your usage. We collect information about how you use our Products, such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts, videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect information about how you use features like our camera.<br/>
    Information about transactions made on our Products. If you use our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card information; other account and authentication information; and billing, shipping and contact details.<br/>
    Things others do and information they provide about you. We also receive and analyze content, communications and information that other people provide when they use our Products.
